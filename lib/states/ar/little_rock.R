# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] While the data seems reasonable -- there were ~51k
# traffic stop calls in 2017 according to the "2017 Annual Report Little Rock
# Police Department" and we have ~20k citations through November
# 2017 -- we appear to only have data on those stops that resulted in
# citations, which means we don't have stops that didn't result in an action
# taken and we don't have the other actions taken, namely warnings and arrests
