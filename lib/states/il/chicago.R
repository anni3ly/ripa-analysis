# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] This data is from a FOIA request directly to the Chicago
# Police Department. There is also local Chicago data in the statewide
# directory, but it has disparate schemas and organization; i.e. 2007 is
# consistent, but other years have the PD broken down into sub-PDs, i.e.
# University Police, Ridge Police, North Chicago Police, etc. Because of the
# difficulty in reconciling all those disparate data sources over years, we
# elected to use the data delivered directly from our city-level FOIA request
# here. The 2017 annual report has arrests by race for 2016 (pg. 83). The total
# number of arrests is stated as 85,752; we have 37,817 associated with traffic
# stops which seems reasonable.
