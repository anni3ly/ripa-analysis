# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] According to the 2014 Annual Report, there were 130k
# traffic citations, 94.18% of which were vehicular, so roughly 122k.
# our data shows 65k citations in 2014, although we do have a small gap in
# reporting in 2014
# TODO(phoebe): Why are they showing nearly double the citations for 2014 in
# their report ~122k vs 65k?
