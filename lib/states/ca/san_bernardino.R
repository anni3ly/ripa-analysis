# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] The San Bernardino City's website offers traffic and
# crime stats, and the county sheriff's 2017 Annual Report also lists detailed
# crime, but there doesn't appear to be any easily accessible public reference
# for vehicular/pedestrian stops; however, the number of stops seems
# relatively appropriate given a population of ~200k
# NOTE: in 2011 we only have partial data
