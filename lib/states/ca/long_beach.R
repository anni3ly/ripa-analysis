# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] Long Beach's Police Department's FY 2018 report is
# mostly budgeting and high level aggregate figures, but it does say there were
# 567k calls responded to in 2016, and we have 15k tickets issued, which seems
# reasonable; it appears as though this data is ticket/citation related, so we
# don't have other types of outcomes
# TODO(phoebe): why are the stops going down so fast yoy from 2009 to 2016?
