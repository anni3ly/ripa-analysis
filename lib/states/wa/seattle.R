# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] The Seattle PD doesn't appear to put out Annual Reports
# or statistics on all traffic stops, but the numbers seem reasonable given the
# population. Unfortunately, a lot of relevant demographic data appears to be
# missing.

# NOTE: The Seattle PD has a smaller dataset focused only on Terry stops here:
