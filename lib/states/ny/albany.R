# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] Neither the "Safer Neighborhoods through Precision
# Policing Initiative" nor the 2018 Prospectus seem to collect statistics on
# traffic stops, although the Prospectus has some figures on crime. That said,
# the counts seem reasonable for a city of its size, with the exception of a
# few days in 2015

# TODO(phoebe): What happened on 2015-04-29, 2015-05-02, and 2015-05-23; there
# are massive spikes in stops
