# NOTE: January 2013 looks suspiciously low in both the old OPP data and in this cleaned version
# NOTE: search/hit counts are a bit different between old opp and this version, because the old
# opp counted all search NAs as FALSE, whereas we check other fields when NA. (i believe our new
# method to be more accurate)
# NOTE: there are also some slight discrepancy in by-month numbers throughout 2013 and 2014, between
# old opp and this cleaned data (even after filtering to the patrol-only data); 
# though the total counts and race breakdowns are identical between
# old opp and newly cleaned data. it is unclear to me where these discrepancies arise from. it is 
# possible that 2013 sheets 23467 should be used instead of sheet 1, however when merging the two,
# they line up identically, so i can't see that helping.
# TODO(amyshoe): figure out what is causing discrepancies between old and new opp data in by-month 
# 2013 counts
