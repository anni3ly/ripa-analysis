# NOTE: the NC cities break the contract implicit in all other city processing
# files; most can be sourced without assuming other files have already been
# sourced; however, in the case of NC, we process all statewide data in
# statewide.R; rather than copying the contents of this script over to every
# city, we elected to break the contract in this case and assume opp.R has
# already been sourced and we have access to opp_load_raw("nc", "statewide")
# and opp_load_clean("nc", "statewide"); this means a few things: (1) metadata
# will refer to the entire statewide metadata, i.e. loading problems, and (2)
# raw_row_number will not be unique to this file, but to NC as a whole, i.e. a
# city might contain ids 1, 5, 20, 2182, etc...but the data generated by
# statewide.R will have all ids

# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] The 2010 Annual Report lists some figures, but they're
# only crime statistics. For comparison, though, there were ~29k non-traffic
# arrests in 2010, and there were ~4k traffic ones in this data, so that seems
# reasonable. 2000 and 2001 only have partial data. See TODOs in statewide.R
# for outstanding tasks
