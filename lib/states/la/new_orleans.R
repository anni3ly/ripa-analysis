# VALIDATION: [GREEN] Almost no data before 2010. The New Orlean's
# "Bias-Free-Policing-annual-report-2015.pdf" has statistics on stops by
# subject race, and out percentages nearly perfectly match them; the
# discrepancy is likely due to what counts as a traffic/pedestrian stop;
# namely, we have some offenses here that aren't classified as either by the
# PD.
