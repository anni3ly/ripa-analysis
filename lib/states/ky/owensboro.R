# VALIDATION: [GREEN] There is only partial data fro 2015 and 2017. The PD's
# 2016 Annual Report cites figures that are similar to those in the data; for
# instance, there were 308 "Street Crimes Unit" arrests; we have 429 arrests
# from traffic violations, which is in the same neighborhood. The Annual
# Report doesn't give any traffic statistics but the data here seems to be on
# the same magnitude as that in the report.
# NOTE: There are some aggregate statistics in excel files for 2016/early 2017
# on citations and drugs in the data directory
