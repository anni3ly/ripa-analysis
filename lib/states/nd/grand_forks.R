# VALIDATION: [YELLOW] The Grand Forks PD's 2016 Annual Report cites figures
# that don't totally correspond to our classification here, but are not far
# off. It's not clear what is considered a traffic stop by the PD (i.e. a
# pedestrian stop but as it relates to traffic law?). There are also some
# peculiar spikes, usually at least 1 day a year, that is a clear outlier.

# TODO(phoebe): why are there always spikes around may/june? The following days
# have massive spikes, relatively speaking:
# 2010-05-08 (147)
# 2011-06-02 (157)
# 2012-05-05 (173)
# 2013-05-04 (185)
# 2014-05-10 (138)
# 2015-05-09 (112)
# 2016-05-20 (78)
