AZ:
  - Notes from old OPP: Excluded from analysis because contraband_found too messy
  - Contraband seems fine for us; let's add in AZ!
  - Has search basis

CA:
  - Notes from old OPP: Excluded from analysis because no contraband info for searches without listed search basis (i.e., most searches)
  
CO:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.
  - Has search basis

CT:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.
  - Filter to `department_name == "State Police"` for all state analysis
  - Differences from old OPP: We have 6 extra months of data in 2015
  - Has search basis, but only in ~93% of searches

IL:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.
  - Filter to `department_name == "ILLINOIS STATE POLICE"` for all state analysis
  - Use beat instead of county_name (corresponds to department districts; many-to-one correspondence with counties)
  - Differences from old OPP: We drop data prior to 2012, and have two additional years (2016, 2017); Also, we have no state patrol data from 2013; they do, somehow?

MA:
  - Notes from old OPP: Excluded from analysis because contraband_found too messsy
  - Contraband is a little messy but seems fine; let's add in MA!
  - Has search basis, but only in ~91% of searches

MD:
  - Excluded because no sub-geography information (TODO: worth geocoding locations? not sure if they're good enough -- just intersections)

MO:
  - Excluded because no sub-geography information

NC:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.
  - Differences from old OPP: We use county (they use 2letter district codes)
  - Has search basis

OH:
  - Excluded in old opp because only search reasons listed are k9 and consent, which they say makes them skeptical of the recording scheme; however, 87% of searches are not labeled -- we call default them to probable cause, but regardless, it seems reasonable to assume that all searches are indeed being tallied up, but i would not trust the search_basis categorization itself. Thus we _do_ use OH in our analysis
  - Has search basis -- but DON'T TRUST

RI:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.
  - Use zone instead of county_name
  - Has search basis

SC:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.
  - Contraband is determined by `!is.na(ContrabandDesc)`, as the old OPP did.
  - TODO: Be a little more judicious is separating out the few rows that, while not NA for ContrabandDesc, indicate no contraband was found. There appear to be very few such rows, so this can be a low priority todo. But worth doing to be rigorous.
 
TX:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.

VT:
  - Excluded from old OPP 
  - Missing sub-geography (county) -- we have lat long for most stops though -- can't we just extract county from that?

WA:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.

WI:
  - Used in old OPP threshold test.
